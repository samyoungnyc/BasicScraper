BasicScraper
============
This is the most basic web scraper that grabs links from sites using the BeautifulSoup module. 
I'm pretty proud of it as it took me a while to figure out. One thing I can say about programming
is, don't rely solely on shortcuts and skimming. Sometimes you have to get dirty and really comb 
through documentation.If I had done that, I would have saved myself a lot of time and agony. Thanks
to all the people throwing tutorials up there. Also, thanks to the makers of BeautifulSoup and this
particular tutorial:

For some reason, that one finally got me going.
