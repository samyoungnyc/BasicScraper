BasicScrapers
============

These are very basic Scrapers that I have built using the BeautifulSoup module. I will be saving 
specific Scrapers as I go along. Hopefully anyone building one can check this out and find it useful.

I'm pretty proud of this as it took me a while to figure out. One thing I can say about programming
is, don't rely solely on shortcuts and skimming. Sometimes you have to get dirty and really comb 
through documentation. If I had done that, I would have saved myself a lot of time and agony. Thanks
to all the people throwing tutorials up there. Also, thanks to the makers of BeautifulSoup. The documentation
for their great module is here:

and thanks to this particular tutorial:

For some reason, that one finally got me going.
